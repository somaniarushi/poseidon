What if there was a way to arrange the way you think? To be able to organise your idea, connect them, sort them, isolate them, and thread them together? This is the idea behind Codestorm. 

In its current iteration, codestorm operates like a tree -- with a root node and branching options. The idea is to be able to start a project, add categories to it, and create a flow of thought with them. Every thought can further have ideas, every idea resources, and every resource concerns.

Eventually, I'd like to be able to customize everything Every project may be a unique combination of thoughts and curiosities, with its own tags. I'd also like the ability to "connect" two disjoint ideas and to be able to move them around into different trees, but that's clearly a later down the line idea.

It is very important to me to get this right. There are few projects that I think of that I do not find some valid substitute for. This is one of them. I do not know how long this is take, or what this is eventually become, but I am determined to bring it to life. 

###### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
